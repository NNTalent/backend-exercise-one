## Hi there! Let's do a Node exercise together.

### What's this exercise about?

We've got a rather large json file in the cloud, accessible at `http://users-list.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/data.json`. 72 MB of data, to be precise.

### What do I have to do?

In the `index.js` file you will find an empty `main()` function. You'll have to write the code to retrieve the JSON file from the url described above and save it in a local file called `userData.json`.

You can run your solution using `npm start` and you can test your solution using `npm test`.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important detail: The maximum memory allocation size for this Node program is 64 MB. Anything more than that and the program will crash.

You're free to use whatever you want in terms of libraries or frameworks to solve this exercise.

Good luck! üí™
